Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction 

This project focused on analyzing customer behavior to understand why they leave, helping businesses craft better retention strategies. By leveraging machine learning models, I was able to accurately predict churn and identify patterns that can guide retention efforts. 

Steps:

- Data Preparation: I processed customer data from Kaggle to ensure clean inputs for model training. 
- Model Training on Google Colab: I built and tested several models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with a focus on optimizing recall to accurately catch potential churners.
- Interactive Web App: Developed a web app on Replit that not only provides churn predictions but also uses an LLM with GROQ AI to generate personalized emails and explanations of the modelâ€™s predictions.
